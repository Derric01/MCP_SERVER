# 🦙 LangChain + Ollama + Chroma (Basic Setup)

## 📖 Overview
This repository is a **minimal starter project** that shows how to connect:
- **LangChain** → to build workflows with LLMs  
- **Ollama** → to run LLMs locally  
- **Chroma** → as a vector database for storing embeddings  

It also introduces the idea of **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**, which allows models to connect with external tools and data sources.  
This repo is meant as a **learning playground** to understand the core pieces working together.
